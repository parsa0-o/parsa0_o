                    class="imgchecklist">
                <p>This code creates a click event for an element with the ID 'translate-btn'. When the user clicks on
                    this
                    button, a
                    function is executed that assigns three initial variables using the document.querySelector method:

                    sourceLanguage: the source language (original text) entered in the element with the ID
                    source-language.
                    targetLanguage:
                    the target language (translated text) entered in the element with the ID target-language.
                    sourceText:
                    the
                    text
                    entered
                    by the user in the element with the ID source-text. Then, using the fetch() function, an inline
                    request
                    is
                    sent to the
                    Google Translate API. The API address is added to the request as follows
                    This address allows you to translate the sourceText into the target language using sourceLanguage
                    and
                    targetLanguage.
                    The response returned by the API for this request contains a three-dimensional array that includes
                    the
                    translated text.
                    In this code, the translated text is displayed in the element with the ID target-text.

                    If you want to put this code on GitHub, you can create a file named translate.js in the js folder
                    and
                    include
                    the above
                    code in it. Then, in your HTML file, add the translate.

                <h2>remove silence from audio</h2>
                <img src="remove_silence_from_audio.JPG" alt="اینجا جای ی عکس که بخاطر داشتن هاست رایگان هنوز لود نشده"
                    class="imgchecklist">
                <p>This code defines a function called remove_silence that takes two file paths as input:
                    input_file_path,
                    which
                    is the
                    path to the audio file from which the silences will be removed, and output_file_path, which is the
                    path
                    where
                    the
                    resulting audio file will be saved.

                    The function first loads the audio file using the AudioSegment class from the pydub library. It then
                    calculates the
                    average dBFS level of the audio file and sets the silence threshold to this value.

                    The minimum silence length is calculated based on the length of the audio file and set to 5% of its
                    total
                    duration. The
                    detect_nonsilent method from the pydub.silence module is used to split the audio into non-silent
                    parts
                    based
                    on the
                    silence threshold and minimum silence length.

                    Finally, the function concatenates the non-silent parts of the audio that are longer than the
                    minimum
                    silence
                    length
                    using the AudioSegment.empty() method and exports the resulting audio to the specified output file
                    path
                    in
                    WAV
                    format
                    using the export method.

                    Overall, this code removes silences from an audio file and saves the remaining audio to a new file.

                <p>Since I needed to write my work in a checklist and I am very interested in working with the computer,
                    I
                    decided to make
                    a checklist and later I decided that it should be a web application that can be on my phone and on
                    the
                    system.
                    After it
                    was made and I saw a lot of interest from people around me to use this web application, I decided to
                    make a
                    more
                    beautiful appearance for it, which took about a day, but in the end it was user-friendly, and now
                    nearly
                    ten
                    of my close
                    friends are using it. They use the online checklist and I am satisfied. I am also satisfied and
                    happy
                    with

                <p>Recently, in order to get myself more involved in coding and to create a resume and to have some work
                    samples, I decided
                    to create my own website or a blog and post content on it, both from my own work and from what the
                    site
                    provides for
                    others. It will be useful because this will also make me code more and I can be daily and post my
